# AI Use Log
- Tool/model & version:
- What I asked for:
- Snippet of prompt(s):
- What I changed before committing:
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data):

Date/Time: I did Rosalind 1, 2 and 3 on Sept. 2, 2025, 10:57 p.m. (CT)  
- Tool/model & version: Google Gemini (via Google Colab), accessed Sept. 2, 2025
- What I asked for: I copied the questions and answer of the original questions and asked Gemini to explain how they got the answer. it generated the code and run it.
- What I changed before committing:  
  - Used my own variable names and comments.  
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): 
  - Manually checked with `a=983`, `b=961`: `983**2 + 961**2 = 1,889,810`.  
  - Also starting with the example is a good way to be sure


# AI USE LOG - ROSALIND BIOINFORMATICS PROBLEMS f6r 4,5,6 to 9
# Date: September 6, 2025
# Completion Time: Multiple sessions across two days
# TOOLS & MODELS USED:
 - Google Gemini (accessed via Google Colab)
 - ChatGPT (GPT-4 version)
# PURPOSE OF AI ASSISTANCE:
 - Explanations of sample code functionality
# SAMPLE PROMPTS USED:
"""
 "Can you break down this sample dataset result"
 I copied the sample data and output to gemini and asked to explain the code
 
"""
# MODIFICATIONS MADE BEFORE COMMITTING:
 - Additional comments 
 - Input validation and error handling
# VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY:
 - Initial testing with provided sample datasets
 - Cross-validation with expected sample outputs 
 - Manual calculation verification (e.g., 983² + 961² = 1,889,810)
 - Final validation on main Rosalind datasets
# ADDITIONAL NOTES:
 - Prior Python experience accelerated problems 4-9 completion
 - AI explanations particularly helpful for recurrence relations
 - Used hints section for main dataset requirements
 - Studied Beginning Bioinformatics Part Three
 - Step-by-step guidance IN  Beginning Bioinformatics Part Three is very helpful
